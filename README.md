osx mountain lion (10.8)
------------------------

there is a bug with postfix configuration with Mountain Lion that [causes an error](http://blog.deversus.com/2012/07/fix-for-postfix-in-mac-os-x-10-8-mountain-lion/). This fixed it for me:

```
sudo mkdir -p /Library/Server/Mail/Data/spool
sudo /usr/sbin/postfix set-permissions
sudo /usr/sbin/postfix start
```

spotlight
---------

follow [these directions](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/7135) for turning off spotlight indexing.

future
------

1. simple installer
1. other platforms?
1. strava is working on an upload api and deprecating the email interface
